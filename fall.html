<center><p> This is the perfect meme for fall because fall is the time when school starts up again. This meme is about the pressure we put on students to perform. Many students feel as if their whole self worth is based on their grades in school. This pressure from society leads students to be so stressed they do things like have panic attacks and bite computers and sometimes the stress can lead to death. The way the image gives the illusion that it's shaking, it's clear this woman's whole world is falling down. An absolute shame. Here at Four Seasons of Memes, being students ourselves know the pain and pressure that society places on children and the affect it can have on us. Please get help if you are stuggling. You don't have to struggle alone.
