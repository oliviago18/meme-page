    <center><p> This meme really makes you reflect. It's all about how you can think you know someone by their name but you really don't know their story. Winnie the Pooh seems like just a fun loving bear that loves honey. Now that we know the name on his birth certificate is Wincent the Poop, EVERYTHING feels different. Who knew our favorite bear was going through such a difficult situation such as keeping his name from the public? It makes me wonder: did Tigger even know?! The whole world loves Winnie the Pooh and some even feel like they have a close relationship with him. However we really know nothing. We shouldn't just assume that everything is fine and that we know everything about a person (or bear) when we really don't. This meme was eye-opening and really put things in perspective.</p></center>
