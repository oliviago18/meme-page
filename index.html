    <center><h3>Mission Statement</h3></center>
    <center><p> Ever wondered what the purpose of memes were? Are they just to make you laugh at and forget about? Or are they something so much more? Here at Four Season of Memes, we believe the latter. We started out as two girls from California with a dream. A dream to change the world one meme at a time.This website explores the deeper, physchological meaning behind your favorite memes. We ask the hard questions like what does this mean? How does this reflect current times? What does this say about humanity? The teenieboppers may not realize this, but often times memes are commentary on today's society and how we function as a human race. We feel it's our purpose to show you how wise memes truly are and how we should utalize them to make a difference and make the world a better place. Each meme is correlates to a different season. Some descriptions say what the meme has to do with the season... others don't. Figure out what it means to you and find your way to a connection between season and meme. Through this website we want to make you think, reflect, and search. We will educate you on the bigger picture and the deeper meaning which will give you a whole new outlook on life that you never knew you needed.</p></center>
