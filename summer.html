    <center><p>This meme says so much. Since this is the summer category this meme is talking about raving. At first glance this is might seem like your classic meme.This is actually a commentary on peer pressure. This man's friends clearly pressured him into raving with them even though he had other responsibilities as seen in the first image. However later that day, the man decides that it's just best to stay home and take care of his responsibilities instead of going out.  The second image is how his peers saw him after he says he doesn't want to rave with them: discombobulated and the mascot for pure lunacy. Peer pressure is not okay. This man was merely one victim of this crime, but there are billions of people suffering from a sticky situation they just don't know how to say no to.</p></center>
